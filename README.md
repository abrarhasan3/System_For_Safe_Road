# Safe Road

This Project is about ensuring safety on road. The project is devided into two part. 
   
    1. Ensuing Assistance of the Driver
    2. Fully Monitoring of the vechile.

## Ensuing Driver Assistance: 
    We would like to detect the traffic sign by a trained Machine Learing model and alert the driver before reaching near the traffic sign.
    Here YOLOv4 model is used to detect this. 
    # The ipynb file contains the code for this.
    Currently this model can detect only 4 sign. 
        
        1. Prohibitory
        2. Mandetory
        3. Danger
        4. Other

## Monitoring of vechile:
    This is done with an android app which would be used to track the buses current location.
    The application provides some more exiting feature for the admin pannel like:
        
        1. Designing a route from google maps.
        2. Assigning some point in the maps with a specific time schedule which the vechile must follow. 
        3. Editing or Deleting the route.
        4. Assigning a specific route to a trip.
        5. Seing the overall report of this trip (Late on the which point, Arrival Time etc).
